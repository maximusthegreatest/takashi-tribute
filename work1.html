	  		<p>Murakami and West were introduced when West's record label reached out to Murakami and asked if the rapper could come see one of Murakami's sculptures. The sculpture in question was a woman with large breasts resembling a Japanese anime take on the hyper-sexualized "French maid" costume. Murakami invited West to his studio and West was so fascinated by his art that he asked him to design his new album cover. West loved his art but he had his own vision for the project as well and it took years to finalize the cover art.</p>
